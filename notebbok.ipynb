A fter these analysis, the paper g ets a co n-clusion that although the high- quality products and good brand awareness of Apple Inc allow this company to attract an lot  of potential customers and strengthen  their  loyalties , it is also very important  to capt ure the market shares from other strong competitors such as Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo  by invest ing more money into the eme rging markets than other rivals, keeping innovation and lower ing pricing s.  Keywords  Apple Inc, technology Industry, Market Expanding   1. Introduction  Apple Inc belongs to  the technology industry, which is the  most valuable and growing industry in global market. The technology industry has two major se c-tors: hardware and software . On one hand, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, Intel, Sony, and Xiaomi are the representatives of the hardware  [1]. Their business includes the personal computer, mobile phone, tablet, music player, and other electronic devices. On the other hand, IBM, Microsoft, and Android are participat ing in the software sector. Besides, some other companies like Apple Inc and Google are play ing the important role in the both sectors. In the technology industry, every large successful compan y has some similar strateg ies in quality, price, in-novation, gl obalization, and consumer spending area [2]. By the development of the science, an increasing number of companies invest in the technology indu s-try. And the competition is becoming fiercer between the companies in the ma-How to cite this paper: Zhang , Q. (201 8) Research on Apple Inc ’s Current Develo p-ing Conditions .

Most companies launch their new pro d-ucts with the most advanced technology or concepts in each year. The leader in the technology industry will create the new standard or rules based on their products , and the followers always produce  the products around popular sta n-dards  [3]. Many median or small size companies are providing the products with low price and high performance to take the market sh are from the large comp a-nies. By saturating in the western market, those technology companies are ai m-ing to expand  in emerging market s like China. And those companies outsourced the assembling process to some Asian countries to lower the cost and earn more  profit  [4]. Apple Inc was created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976  [5]. At the b e-ginning, Apple Inc only produced easy -to-use computer to the PC market. Due to the special designing and revolutionary concepts, Apple Inc became the i n-dustry leader since 1980. At the same year, Apple Inc launched a successful IPO. Nowadays, Apple Inc is the most valuable company in the history of the wor ld [6]. Apple Inc created a lot of revolutionary products like Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple watch. This company also brought some great applic a-tions and system, like iOS and Apple Pay to consumers as well. In the future, Apple Inc is going to c hallenge the unfamiliar industries suc h as car and cable. After the death of founder Jobs, Apple Inc is trying to creating the new lege n-dary stories under the lead of new CEO Tim Cook.  2. Current Developing Strategies  Apple Inc’s current strategy is designed to improve two key areas: products and marketing. It aims to strengthen the ability of competition in the technology market.  Apple Inc’s product strategy focuses on three aspects. Firstly, introducing more innovations and expand its product lines. Apple Inc launches a new gene r-ation of prod uct every year. By improving the performance and using new tec h-nologies on the products to defeat the rivals in the mobile phone, tablets, and computer market. Secondly, Apple Inc creates more new products routinely to catch the market shares. The Apple Wa tch and Apple P ay become the star product s and concept s in the whole market. Consumers are willing to buy the service and advanced technologies to improve their life. In the future, Apple Inc is going to compete in  the traditional car and new energy car industry. Thus, Apple Inc pa id a lot attention on the customer experience to expand the u n-known area in the technology industry.  The Marketing strategy for Apple Inc is to build a global brand through all  the market s [7]. It tried its best to k eep expanding the customer base, attracting new customers, and strengthening the connection with loyal customers by launching new produc ts and expanding on the emerging market. According to its financial  data in 2015, sales were particularly robust in China, the world’s largest smar t-phone market  [8]. Apple Inc knows the importance of the emerging market like China in the world. The great number of potential consumers means huge pro f-Q. Zhang    DOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 41 Open Journal of Business and Management   its to the company. Thus, Apple Inc produced iPhone 5C to move down -market. The lower price and similar functions are go od ways to increase the consump-tion in those kind s of market s. 3. Analysis of Apple Inc ’s Condition  3.1. PESTEL Analysis  A PESTEL analysis is based on the macro environment of an industry and anal y-sis how it could affect the whole technology industry. PESTEL focuses on six a s-pects: political factors, economic conditions, socio -cultural forces, technological factors, environmental forces, and legal factors.  \\uf06c Political Factors —Weak  The case did not describe  political factors that influence d the technology in-dustry , so the political factors are weak to technology companies, electronic d e-vices manufacturers, and consumers.  However, Apple Inc outsources its produ c-tion and assembling  to global sourcing, which was subject to strict producing control and must mee t the requirements from foreign governments. Besides, the other foreign brands such as Xiaomi and Samsung may get the support, prote c-tion, and special treatments from their domestic countries, which could cause fiercer  competition in the current market.  \\uf06c Economic Conditions —Strong  The economic conditions have the strong effects on technology industry companies. In the aftermath of the recessions and economic slowdowns since 2008, the emerging country like China has become the world ’s largest smar t-phone marke t. Besides, the labor cost and materials cost are both affected by the general economic conditions. Thus the price of electronic products has  to change the pricing strategy in the different periods.  \\uf06c Socio -cultural Forces —Moderate  Socio -cultural forces have  the moderate effects. Consumers want to spend less money but have the similar or even better quality of products in consumption. Thus, an increasing number of brands would like provide the products with high performances and low prices to reach the customers ’ requirements.  \\uf06c Technological factors —Strong  Technological factors were also strongly affected the technology industry. The advantages in technology are the core strengthens to a technology company in the market. Technological factors not only affect th e hardware, but also decide the development of software and peripherals in the market. On the other hand, the innovation promotes  the technology for the market and brings the most profits for the leader.  3.2. Five Forces Analysis  Apple Inc is necessary to use Five Forces to access the current situation, market shares, and profitability in the current market and technology industry. It is helpful to evaluate the competition from new entrants, rivals, substitute, and Q. Zhang      DOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 42 Open Journal of Business and Management   bargaining power  from customer and supplier.  \\uf06c Competition from new entrants— Weak  The force of competition from new entrants is weak to Apple Inc, because Apple Inc already built a strong brand awareness in worldwide and attracted a huge number of loyal customers in the pas t 40 years since 1976. Besides, Dell, Lenovo, HP, Samsung already take the rest of market share. Those companies not only have the long history, but also have very deep understanding of cu s-tomers’  needs and experienced skills as well. Therefore, the new en trants are not easily to challenge Apple Inc at price prime market in the short time. However, Apple Inc should not ignore some new entrants like Xiaomi with low cost in the market. In the long term, the new entrants are able to take the market share from Apple Inc in the emerging market such as China.  \\uf06c Competition from substitute —Moderate  The force of competition from substitutes is moderate to Apple Inc. Apple Inc has a group of loyal customers due to its quality and value. However, other technology compan ies are able to provide the similar products to customers as well, such as phones, PC, tablets, and watch. So Apple Inc provides a less un i-queness from its rivals like Sony, Dell, HP, Samsung, and Google. For example, PS3 allowed customers to watch videos,  surf the websites, and play the games. And Customers are willing to purchase the similar designing and quality goods at a relatively lower price in the technology market. Therefore, Apple Inc has to introduce truly innovation new products to take market shares from substitutes.  \\uf06c Competition from customer bargaining power —Strong  The force of competition from customer bargaining power is strong to Apple Inc, because Apple Inc is one of the large technology company in the world. Customers have many options in the electronic products from various brands. In the software area, customers can also purchase the application from Microsoft or Google.  \\uf06c Competition from supplier bargaining power —Weak  The force of competition from supplier bargaining is week to Apple Inc,  be-cause Apple Inc doesn ’t have various options in choosing materials like battery, microprocessors, and protocols from many suppliers in the market. Qualcomm provides the most important protocols for wireless service, like CDMA(3G) and LTE(4G). Apple Inc has to co -work with Qualcomm to save the cost instead of studying this technology by itself. On the other hand, the Intel and ARM pr o-duces the CPU for computers. There are not many companies have the ability to do produce the most important part for phones and computers in the market.  \\uf06c Competition from rival sellers— Strong  The force if competition from rival  sellers is strong to Apple Inc in the ma r-ket. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Google strongly challenge Apple Inc in personal computer area. Xiaomi, Samsung, and Lenovo compete with iPhone  in mobile phone area. Thirdly, Android and Microsoft share the market share with IOS system. The rivals also produce the high quality products and service to co n-sumers. However, innovation is the most valuable strengthens than it s rivals. Q. Zhang    DOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 43 Open Journal of Business and Management   Thus Apple Inc still has the higher market share and sustainable growth in pro f-its. As the leader in technology industry, Apple Inc needs to find the more o p-portunities and creative ideas to keep the advantages in those areas.  3.3. Financial Anal ysis  3.3.1. Solvency Analysis  As can be seen from the above  Table  1, Apple Inc’s current ratio and quick ratio showed a downward trend, indicating that the company’s solvency is weak.  At the same time , the company has a high financial r isk. 3.3.2. Operating Capacity Analysis  As can be seen from the Table  2, Apple Inc’s total asset turnover rate decreased year by year, indicating that Apple Inc’s asset utilization has been reduced, the company’s operating capacity is weakening. Income continues to increase, ind i-cating that the Apple Inc market continues to expand.  3.3.3. Profitability Analysis According to the VRINE analysis, we can easily figure out the advantage of A p-ple Inc Inc with the data in Table 3  and Table 4 . in its Brand. Customers believe in the brand and have willing to buy the products from Apple Inc. Besides, the technology and innovation are the most important for Apple Inc to maintain the advantages in the market. H owever, we cannot ignore the price of all products from Apple Inc. On the one hand, the high price will bring more profits to Apple Inc. On the other hand, Apple Inc will lose the low -income consumers’  market. That is reason why Xiaomi is becoming the stro ngest  competitor in emerging market and developing countries.  3.4. Market Share Analysis  From the Table  5 can be seen, Android system market share increased year by year and there are more than iOS system trends. This shows that the And roid system will become Apple Inc’s strong competitors.  4. Conclusion and Suggestions  4.1. Conclusion  The high- quality products and good brand awareness of Apple Inc allow this company to attract an increasing number of potential customers and strengthen  their loyalties. It is very important for a company to capture the market shares from other strong competitors such as Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo. In addition, Apple Inc can invest more money into the emerging markets to take market share than other rivals b y advertising, and lower  the prices. Apple Inc is very good at cutting the cost and learning from the competitor , which should be d e-veloped . Besides, introducing more innovations and great designs for consumers  are also necessary . Finally, Apple Inc should  pay more attention to the unfami-liar but growing new industries such as the new energy automobile.  Q.

A s a result of that, Xiaomi’ s products  become  a perfect alternative choice for the lo w-er income consumers. Google created a new PC named chromebook recently. Chrombook provide s the necessary functions and good customer services to consumers at a very low price. That is the reason why Google, Dell, and Sa m-sung can quickly capture the emerging market with their PCs and tablets. The correct pr icing strategy is helpful to a company to increase its  competitive abil i-ties.

The technology industry has two major se c-\\ntors: hardware and software . On one hand, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, Intel, Sony, \\nand Xiaomi are the representatives of the hardware  [1]. Their business includes \\nthe personal computer, mobile phone, tablet, music player, and other electronic \\ndevices. On the other hand, IBM, Microsoft, and Android are participat ing in \\nthe software sector. Besides, some other companies like Apple Inc and Google are play ing the important role in the both sectors. In the technology industry, \\nevery large successful compan y has some similar strateg ies in quality, price, in-\\nnovation, gl obalization, and consumer spending area [2]. By the development of \\nthe science, an increasing number of companies invest in the technology indu s-\\ntry.

Most companies launch their new pro d-\\nucts with the most advanced technology or concepts in each year. The leader in \\nthe technology industry will create the new standard or rules based on their \\nproducts , and the followers always produce  the products around popular sta n-\\ndards  [3]. Many median or small size companies are providing the products with \\nlow price and high performance to take the market sh are from the large comp a-\\nnies. By saturating in the western market, those technology companies are ai m-\\ning to expand  in emerging market s like China. And those companies outsourced \\nthe assembling process to some Asian countries to lower the cost and earn more  \\nprofit  [4]. \\nApple Inc was created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976  [5]. At the b e-\\nginning, Apple Inc only produced easy -to-use computer to the PC market. Due \\nto the special designing and revolutionary concepts, Apple Inc became the i n-\\ndustry leader since 1980. At the same year, Apple Inc launched a successful IPO. \\nNowadays, Apple Inc is the most valuable company in the history of the wor ld \\n[6]. Apple Inc created a lot of revolutionary products like Macintosh, iPod, \\niPhone, iPad, and Apple watch. This company also brought some great applic a-\\ntions and system, like iOS and Apple Pay to consumers as well. In the future, \\nApple Inc is going to c hallenge the unfamiliar industries suc h as car and cable. \\nAfter the death of founder Jobs, Apple Inc is trying to creating the new lege n-\\ndary stories under the lead of new CEO Tim Cook.  \\n2. Current Developing Strategies  \\nApple Inc’s current strategy is designed to improve two key areas: products and \\nmarketing. It aims to strengthen the ability of competition in the technology \\nmarket.  \\nApple Inc’s product strategy focuses on three aspects. Firstly, introducing \\nmore innovations and expand its product lines. Apple Inc launches a new gene r-\\nation of prod uct every year. By improving the performance and using new tec h-\\nnologies on the products to defeat the rivals in the mobile phone, tablets, and \\ncomputer market. Secondly, Apple Inc creates more new products routinely to \\ncatch the market shares. The Apple Wa tch and Apple P ay become the star \\nproduct s and concept s in the whole market. Consumers are willing to buy the \\nservice and advanced technologies to improve their life. In the future, Apple Inc \\nis going to compete in  the traditional car and new energy car industry. Thus, \\nApple Inc pa id a lot attention on the customer experience to expand the u n-\\nknown area in the technology industry.  \\nThe Marketing strategy for Apple Inc is to build a global brand through all  the \\nmarket s [7]. It tried its best to k eep expanding the customer base, attracting new \\ncustomers, and strengthening the connection with loyal customers by launching \\nnew produc ts and expanding on the emerging market. According to its financial  \\ndata in 2015, sales were particularly robust in China, the world’s largest smar t-\\nphone market  [8]. Apple Inc knows the importance of the emerging market like \\nChina in the world. The great number of potential consumers means huge pro f-Q. Zhang  \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 41 Open Journal of Business and Management  \\n its to the company. Thus, Apple Inc produced iPhone 5C to move down -market. \\nThe lower price and similar functions are go od ways to increase the consump-\\ntion in those kind s of market s. \\n3. Analysis of Apple Inc ’s Condition  \\n3.1. PESTEL Analysis  \\nA PESTEL analysis is based on the macro environment of an industry and anal y-\\nsis how it could affect the whole technology industry. PESTEL focuses on six a s-\\npects: political factors, economic conditions, socio -cultural forces, technological \\nfactors, environmental forces, and legal factors.  \\n\\uf06c Political Factors —Weak  \\nThe case did not describe  political factors that influence d the technology in-\\ndustry , so the political factors are weak to technology companies, electronic d e-\\nvices manufacturers, and consumers.  However, Apple Inc outsources its produ c-\\ntion and assembling  to global sourcing, which was subject to strict producing \\ncontrol and must mee t the requirements from foreign governments. Besides, the \\nother foreign brands such as Xiaomi and Samsung may get the support, prote c-\\ntion, and special treatments from their domestic countries, which could cause \\nfiercer  competition in the current market.  \\n\\uf06c Economic Conditions —Strong  \\nThe economic conditions have the strong effects on technology industry \\ncompanies. In the aftermath of the recessions and economic slowdowns since \\n2008, the emerging country like China has become the world ’s largest smar t-\\nphone marke t. Besides, the labor cost and materials cost are both affected by the \\ngeneral economic conditions. Thus the price of electronic products has  to \\nchange the pricing strategy in the different periods.  \\n\\uf06c Socio -cultural Forces —Moderate  \\nSocio -cultural forces have  the moderate effects. Consumers want to spend less \\nmoney but have the similar or even better quality of products in consumption. \\nThus, an increasing number of brands would like provide the products with high \\nperformances and low prices to reach the customers ’ requirements.  \\n\\uf06c Technological factors —Strong  \\nTechnological factors were also strongly affected the technology industry. The \\nadvantages in technology are the core strengthens to a technology company in \\nthe market. Technological factors not only affect th e hardware, but also decide \\nthe development of software and peripherals in the market. On the other hand, \\nthe innovation promotes  the technology for the market and brings the most \\nprofits for the leader.  \\n3.2. Five Forces Analysis  \\nApple Inc is necessary to use Five Forces to access the current situation, market \\nshares, and profitability in the current market and technology industry. It is \\nhelpful to evaluate the competition from new entrants, rivals, substitute, and Q. Zhang    \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 42 Open Journal of Business and Management  \\n bargaining power  from customer and supplier.  \\n\\uf06c Competition from new entrants— Weak  \\nThe force of competition from new entrants is weak to Apple Inc, because \\nApple Inc already built a strong brand awareness in worldwide and attracted a \\nhuge number of loyal customers in the pas t 40 years since 1976. Besides, Dell, \\nLenovo, HP, Samsung already take the rest of market share. Those companies \\nnot only have the long history, but also have very deep understanding of cu s-\\ntomers’  needs and experienced skills as well. Therefore, the new en trants are not \\neasily to challenge Apple Inc at price prime market in the short time. However, \\nApple Inc should not ignore some new entrants like Xiaomi with low cost in the \\nmarket. In the long term, the new entrants are able to take the market share \\nfrom Apple Inc in the emerging market such as China.  \\n\\uf06c Competition from substitute —Moderate  \\nThe force of competition from substitutes is moderate to Apple Inc. Apple Inc \\nhas a group of loyal customers due to its quality and value. However, other \\ntechnology compan ies are able to provide the similar products to customers as \\nwell, such as phones, PC, tablets, and watch. So Apple Inc provides a less un i-\\nqueness from its rivals like Sony, Dell, HP, Samsung, and Google. For example, \\nPS3 allowed customers to watch videos,  surf the websites, and play the games. \\nAnd Customers are willing to purchase the similar designing and quality goods \\nat a relatively lower price in the technology market. Therefore, Apple Inc has to \\nintroduce truly innovation new products to take market shares from substitutes.  \\n\\uf06c Competition from customer bargaining power —Strong  \\nThe force of competition from customer bargaining power is strong to Apple \\nInc, because Apple Inc is one of the large technology company in the world. \\nCustomers have many options in the electronic products from various brands. \\nIn the software area, customers can also purchase the application from Microsoft \\nor Google.  \\n\\uf06c Competition from supplier bargaining power —Weak  \\nThe force of competition from supplier bargaining is week to Apple Inc,  be-\\ncause Apple Inc doesn ’t have various options in choosing materials like battery, \\nmicroprocessors, and protocols from many suppliers in the market. Qualcomm \\nprovides the most important protocols for wireless service, like CDMA(3G) and \\nLTE(4G). Apple Inc has to co -work with Qualcomm to save the cost instead of \\nstudying this technology by itself. On the other hand, the Intel and ARM pr o-\\nduces the CPU for computers. There are not many companies have the ability to \\ndo produce the most important part for phones and computers in the market.  \\n\\uf06c Competition from rival sellers— Strong  \\nThe force if competition from rival  sellers is strong to Apple Inc in the ma r-\\nket. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Google strongly challenge Apple Inc in personal \\ncomputer area. Xiaomi, Samsung, and Lenovo compete with iPhone  in mobile \\nphone area. Thirdly, Android and Microsoft share the market share with IOS system. The rivals also produce the high quality products and service to co n-\\nsumers. However, innovation is the most valuable strengthens than it s rivals. Q. Zhang  \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/ojbm.2018.61003 43 Open Journal of Business and Management  \\n Thus Apple Inc still has the higher market share and sustainable growth in pro f-\\nits. As the leader in technology industry, Apple Inc needs to find the more o p-\\nportunities and creative ideas to keep the advantages in those areas.  \\n3.3. Financial Anal ysis  \\n3.3.1. Solvency Analysis  \\nAs can be seen from the above  Table  1, Apple Inc’s current ratio and quick ratio \\nshowed a downward trend, indicating that the company’s solvency is weak.  At \\nthe same time , the company has a high financial r isk. \\n3.3.2. Operating Capacity Analysis  \\nAs can be seen from the Table  2, Apple Inc’s total asset turnover rate decreased \\nyear by year, indicating that Apple Inc’s asset utilization has been reduced, the \\ncompany’s operating capacity is weakening. Income continues to increase, ind i-\\ncating that the Apple Inc market continues to expand.  \\n3.3.3. Profitability Analysis \\nAccording to the VRINE analysis, we can easily figure out the advantage of A p-\\nple Inc Inc with the data in Table 3  and Table 4 . in its Brand. Customers believe \\nin the brand and have willing to buy the products from Apple Inc. Besides, the technology and innovation are the most important for Apple Inc to maintain the \\nadvantages in the market. H owever, we cannot ignore the price of all products \\nfrom Apple Inc. On the one hand, the high price will bring more profits to Apple \\nInc. On the other hand, Apple Inc will lose the low -income consumers’  market. \\nThat is reason why Xiaomi is becoming the stro ngest  competitor in emerging \\nmarket and developing countries.  \\n3.4. Market Share Analysis  \\nFrom the Table  5 can be seen, Android system market share increased year by \\nyear and there are more than iOS system trends. This shows that the And roid \\nsystem will become Apple Inc’s strong competitors.  \\n4. Conclusion and Suggestions  \\n4.1. Conclusion  \\nThe high- quality products and good brand awareness of Apple Inc allow this \\ncompany to attract an increasing number of potential customers and strengthen  \\ntheir loyalties. It is very important for a company to capture the market shares \\nfrom other strong competitors such as Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo. In addition, \\nApple Inc can invest more money into the emerging markets to take market \\nshare than other rivals b y advertising, and lower  the prices. Apple Inc is very \\ngood at cutting the cost and learning from the competitor , which should be d e-\\nveloped . Besides, introducing more innovations and great designs for consumers  \\nare also necessary . Finally, Apple Inc should  pay more attention to the unfami-\\nliar but growing new industries such as the new energy automobile.  Q.
